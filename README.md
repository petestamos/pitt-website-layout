This was a UI/UX design project for Pitt's Computer Science capstone course. In this project I led a team of two other developers to create a layout redesign for The University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science Department. Throughout the semester we met with faculty members and conducted user studies on numerous students to gather feedback and base the redesign on those findings. The following page was my primary assignment and acted as a reference point for the other developers.
