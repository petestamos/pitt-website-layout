----------
Strategy:
	-Consolidate Personal Pages into one single area
	-Move info on degrees to prospective students area
	-Better visibility for Student Orgs
	-Better info on hackathons + CS Day

Ideas:
	-have logins for students
		-manage own page, schedule meetings w/ professors for research opps
		-track coursework + requirements
